# Thermomat

Low cost smart home IOT heating with adapted eq3n and esp8266-07.

As i am using homeassistant, i dont need a web ui. Therefore i just used the code from coolibre to send the pulse to the EQ3.
Basically just the test code but it is working as expected. 

For the MQTT implementation it is a basic pubsub client approach. 

Code Basis for controlling the eq3n is from https://github.com/coolibre/thermomat

# General Information

i am not a software developer. But often a git repo helped me to get further with my IOT projects. That's why I decided to share my code as well.
